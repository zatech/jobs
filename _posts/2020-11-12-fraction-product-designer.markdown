Would you be open to explore an opportunity where you'll be the 4th person to join a startup venture who will take on a role as Lead Product Designer?

You will be the first Designer and will get to make decisions from a product perspective.

Looking for someone who knows and enjoys the UX & UI side of things as well as building systems from the ground up.

The product hasn't gone to market yet so this is a once in a lifetime opportunity (according to me).

The role is Fully remote. Eur registered, Silicon Valley funded ex-Uber Founding team. Output>Input driven and I'm almost 100% sure we'll be able to meet your salary expectations!
