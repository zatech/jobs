I need a very basic react-native & firebase project starter kit/foundation to be setup (without `expo`). I tried myself to set one up but just kept on having issues with clashing ios Podfile dependencies.

Basic overview of what is required:

- react native navigation setup with 3 views (login, home & camera)
- login screen uses firebase authentication to login user with email & password and redirect to home screen.
- Home screen should only be accessible with valid firebase  auth session and one button on screen linking to a live camera feed screen
- `react-native-camera` setup to just show live preview of camera (this needs to be setup on a separate screen from home screen)

All UI to be setup with something like Galio framework or better suggestions will be welcomed :). Essentially any library/framework that makes it even more easy to build a pretty & consistent UI with react native

W.r.t Rate & Budget : If you have a similar starter setup/kit already, I'd be happy to pay for that work as an "asset" to be able to commercially use it.
