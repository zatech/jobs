About Libryo

Libryo is an award winning legaltech company, with a remote-first team and global customer base. We’re reorganising the world’s regulatory mess, making it much easier for multinational companies to know and track their applicable law, which in turn drives good governance and sustainable results.

As one of London’s premier legaltech startups, we’re backed by leading early stage funds including Seedcamp, Nextlaw Ventures, Innogy Innovation, Force over Mass, and Ascension Ventures. We’re in the process of closing our next round of funding, and are looking for a new addition to the Libryo engineering team. Maybe it's you?

About the Libryo Platform

By arranging legal obligations around the specific topics that the law regulates, we’re making relevant regulations known to people at global companies. This is done in a context specific and on demand manner through the Libryo Platform, which is a Software as a Service (SaaS) application and via integrations with applications of partners that consume Libryo’s data as a service (DaaS) through the Libryo API.

What it's like to work at Libryo

At Libryo, we have fun, make money and do something good! We stay humble and we treat each other like adults. That means we don't count hours and our focus is on the output - hence we have a generous leave policy.
