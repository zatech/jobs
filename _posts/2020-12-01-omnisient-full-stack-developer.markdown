Want to build groundbreaking technology while working for an invested technology startup

Omnisient enables businesses to innovate and grow profitability through secure data sharing.

Intersect.ai is our data sharing platform that facilitates data collaboration between business entities. We make it much faster and very affordable to create data partnerships with other organizations or internal departments while protecting customer privacy and information security.

Most collaborations start with an exchange of data and this can often take months. We reduce the speed of data collaboration dramatically by applying technology to remove the privacy and information security concerns. Being able to speed up your data collaboration means you can identify lucrative opportunities faster and reduce your investment in qualifying them.

We are hiring developers (5+ years experience) with exposure in working with complex full-stack business applications.

We work with:
* C# (.NET Core + Azure Functions)
* Angular
* SQL
* Big Data

Our primary hosting is Azure and we leverage various analytics, storage and orchestration tools on the Azure environment for use in our platform

You would ideally have:
* Based in Cape Town (weâ€™re remote friendly, but some office days are required)
* A passion for learning and applying your skills with a strong bent for automating systems
* Love sharing with peers
* Substantial development and delivery experience with .NET and Azure technologies
* A keen interest in Agile and Continuous improvement
* An ability to work in a team-oriented environment
* Understanding of best practices, such as iterative development and continuous integration
* Experience in TDD
* An understanding of Data Science (beneficial)

We love people with a creative approach to problem-solving. If you want to be part of and build an open learning orientated culture than reach out. Let's compare notes.
