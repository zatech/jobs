Our product is a hardware sensor that measures network performance from a user perspective. We were a Cape Town based startup that got acquired by Aruba (part of HPE) a few years ago. Now we're growing, and have tons of interesting projects on the go, scaling the current product and adding new features / exploring new ways of using the product.

Backend tech wise we are mostly python and aws and gcp, and we increasingly use k8s.

Growing company :seedling:, interesting data :star_struck:, still small enough to be flexible and let you get involved in lots of different things :tada:, and make your mark :art:, great team :rocket:

Wellness Fridays (== every second Friday of the month we get the afternoon off), 6 months paternity leave! (HPE is actually a pretty progressive company with stuff like this)

Beer on tap at the office, and G&Ts, but I dunno if that even counts because who knows when we will be at the office again :woman_shrugging:

"Other" under remote friendliness is because a new work from home system is currently being worked out (precipitated by covid ofc), so its likely there will be a fair amount of remoteness but the details aren't set yet.
