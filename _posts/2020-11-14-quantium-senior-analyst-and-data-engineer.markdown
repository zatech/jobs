Quantium is a leading data science company, founded in Australia, with offices across APAC, EMEA, the US and India.

In South Africa, we have a team of 20 working in an exciting, start-up environment building and deploying some truly innovative solutions to our valued clients.

We are seeking a strong Senior Analyst to play a key role in building, testing and improving innovative use cases with our flagship analytical product, Q.Refinery. Do not be fooled by the title - this is a super technical role where you'll get your hands dirty wrangling, operationalising, and productionising very large, structured datasets (we partner with one of the biggest retail banks in SA).

You will love to code and build analytical products that have a true commercial impact to improve a client's bottom line.

Our South Africa office is an innovation hub, often building cutting-edge solutions that are scaled out to our hundreds of clients across the globe and training amazing talent to work in our different offices also.

If this sounds like an opportunity you'd be interested to explore further, we'd love to share more, please get in touch!
