You will be an integral and trusted member of the tech team, a mentor to new team members and handle a full caseload of hands-on coding/ implementation projects.

You will be expected to take a leadership and decision-making role in the technical architecture and implementation of the platform build. This includes project prioritisation, evaluating technical debt, technical problem resolution and how to incrementally evolve a solution to reach a target architecture while delivering business value.

You will be expected to execute a number of projects which contribute to the build of our mobile platform, and take responsibility for coding core-feature implementation projects and Greenfield projects. We need someone who will make an impactful contribution, ask great questions, and execute high quality work
