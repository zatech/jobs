As a full-stack web developer you will be working on our JAMstack application (Vue.js SPA on Netlify, Ruby on Rails API on Nanobox) and interacting with other team members to develop features and solutions to improve the system. Specific experience with Rails and Vue is not required if you have sufficient related experience. Willingness to learn and experiment is highly valued at Leaply.

Leaply is currently planning a new project that will use a different tech stack (Go or similar statically-compiled language), so we are looking for developers who know or are eager to learn such a language. If you have been looking to switch over, this is the ideal opportunity to do it at a steady pace.

We are a small team, but we believe in flexibility and autonomy, so we try to allow you to work on what interests you most - frontend, backend, database design or developer operations.
