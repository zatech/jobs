Hi datavis people!

We are currently looking for freelancers who would be keen to help us with data visualisation projects at [The New Humanitarian](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org).

We’re a small, Geneva based non-profit newsroom focussing on crises news. The newsroom is completely remote, I am personally based in Muizenberg, Cape Town.

We’re doing both, interactive data pieces (all based on ReactJS) but also classic/static data visualisation, where needed.
Please get in touch with me if you are either a frontend / React developer or an infographic wizard and into data visualisation. Best case is you love both worlds!

[Example #1](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/special-report/2020/10/14/Africa-coronavirus-famine): Our interactive chatbot and the interactive “Flipcard”. Both done in React at The New Humanitarian

[Example #2](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2020/01/17/Mexico-migrants-Uganda-metering): Image slider example, using our interactive toolbox

[Example #3](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2020/09/29/exclusive-more-50-women-accuse-aid-workers-sex-abuse-congo-ebola-crisis): Vertical timeline, open collapsible element under “Timeline: UN and NGO sex scandals from 1990 to 2020” to see
