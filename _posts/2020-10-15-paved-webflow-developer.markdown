Paved.com is a startup looking for a good, knowledgeable webflow developer to take our newly designed site live. We have 7 pages in total. All of similar length and complexity.

Our existing website was developed by hand. We need someone with attention to detail to recreate all the links. The design is currently in Figma.

There are some minor elements we would like animated. In the future, we'd like to do more complex animations so if you can do that it's a major plus!

Our website's SEO is healthy at the moment. We'd expect a developer to know best practices and keep the SEO rankings in tact.
