A Graduate, a Jnr Developer, as well as a Senior developer to start in Jan 2021.

The vibe is awesome. We work hard, and play hard at the same time. We host tech talks every Friday, and hackathons every 6months with monetary / physical rewards. Developer of the quarter awards with rewards etc.

Does this sound like something you'd like? or do you know someone interested? DM me or alternatively contact the contact person I've left here :)
