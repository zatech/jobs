Last year VPUU set out to build a community-based wireless network to bring internet connectivity into the areas we serve.
Since opening the network to the public in March, we have provided free internet access to over 20,000 users (growing by 1000/month!) in two communities. When connected to the network, users also have access to a wide range of free local/offline content and services.

We are soon to provide low-cost high-speed connectivity, while building out the free educational and communications content and service offerings. We are also planning to expand V-NET into additional townships and informal settlements in the Western Cape.

We are a small, fun, hardworking team looking for a developer to support the provision of content and services within multiple V-NET deployments.
