Dotmodus is a Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Custom Software and Google Cloud / AWS Consulting / Microsoft Partner.

As a frontend developer you will work alongside other members of the front end team to build out the various user facing elements of our software. The role is focused on development over design, but you should have a good eye for design and be able to translate designs to code accurately.

You should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript and experience with Javascript frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular and/or equivalents.

The role will include working on a number of different projects, including web-apps, mobile apps, microsites and the company website and intranet.
