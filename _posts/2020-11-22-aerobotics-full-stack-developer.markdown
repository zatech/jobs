We are looking for a senior full stack software engineer to help us build, architect and maintain our software systems for our customers and internal operations team.

Possible areas of responsibility:

* Building our internal annotation product (for labelling machine learning data).
* Automating integrations with external systems and our own (for example: Salesforce)
* Building out our data pipelines and architecture (ETL, data lake, warehousing)
* Exposing our rich datasets to customers through our web applications.

The areas of responsibility are quite broad and can be made much more specific dependent on the skillset of the candidate.
Looking forward to chatting to you!
