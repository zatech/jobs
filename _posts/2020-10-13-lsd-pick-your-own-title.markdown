Back by popular demand, LSD is hiring! Again!! And we want you!!!

That is right people, last month we managed to snag 2 people for LSD from ZATech and this special is still running for October. What special I hear you saying, wellâ€¦

We are looking for people that love automation, devops, open source, clouds,  Kubernetes and Linux to join us helping our customers on their cloud-native trips.

You should be able to (or at least be able to learn quickly) as we...
Kung Fu Kubernetes
Tackle Terraform
Lacerate Linux
Conquer Clouds
Annihilate Ansible
Dominate DevSecOps

Or in English, we are looking for smart people who can work alongside us in the world of IT by learning new tool sets and working 100% remotely with other LSD Citizens.
